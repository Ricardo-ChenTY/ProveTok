    \midrule
    C0001 & Pass & \ProveTok improves combined quality and grounding across budgets under matched cost, while satisfying latency and supportedness constraints. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0164-full/baselines_curve_multiseed.json}} \\
    C0002 & Pass & Dev$\rightarrow$test regret is statistically bounded and improves over a naive allocation policy in the real pipeline. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0161-full/fig3_regret_sweep.json}} \\
    C0003 & Pass & Counterfactual tests show that removing citations breaks grounding and swapping citations breaks supportedness. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0162-full_retry3/figX_counterfactual_20260206_102521/figX_counterfactual.json}} \\
    C0004 & Pass & Citation-grounding improves over fixed-grid and ROI-style baselines with Holm-significant gains across multiple budgets. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0156-grounding_proof_100g_saliency_full/figX_grounding_proof.json}} \\
    C0005 & Pass & $\tauRef{=}0.002$ meets miss/ECE/refusal constraints and reduces unsupported rates across budgets. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0144-full/figX_refusal_calibration.json}} \\
    C0006 & Pass & Baseline suite and cost accounting are present, with reproducible strong baselines. & \texttt{\detokenize{outputs/E0164-full/baselines_curve_multiseed.json}} \\
